**Note: This project is a work in progress.**

## Overview
Unity 2D RPG is an ongoing project aimed at developing a turn-based RPG game with familiar mechanics inspired by the Xenogears battle system. The game is being developed using Unity, a popular game development engine.

## Features

## Work Done So Far
The following components and features have been implemented in the project:

- `EnemyMob`: Represents enemy mobs in the game with specific stats and behavior.
- `PlayerCharacter`: Represents player characters with customizable attributes and abilities.
- `CharacterStats`: A base class encapsulating common attributes for characters and mobs.
- `BattleEvent`: Handles the logic for the battle event, including enemy spawning and battle mechanics.
- `EventBase`: An abstract base class for event scripts, providing a foundation for event management.
- `GameEventManager`: Manages game events and allows registration and triggering of events.
- `IEvent`: An interface for event classes to ensure required methods are implemented.
- `PlayerManager`: Manages the current player's status, including gold, party members, and items.
- `MenuController`: Handles the menu functionality, such as button clicks and event execution.
